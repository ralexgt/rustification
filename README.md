# Rustification - Learning Rust
The project was started with the sole goal of learning Rust. The solutions are not the best, nor I think the worst, but they should showcase my progress. Also used as a case study for myself to keep up with my learning frequency and observing my code over time.

## Rust Book
In `RustBook` you can find my journey through Rust's official book. There are code samples, mostly commented and some notes where I tought it was viable to 
take notes as comments. You can find it here -> [doc.rust-lang.org/book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)

## Rustlings
Nothing else than the `Rustlings` exercises to practice Rust. My solutions might be different from the official ones, but the differencens should not be significant as the problems as straightforward with their intentions. You can find Rustlings here -> [github.com/rust-lang/rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/)

## Advent of Code in Rust
`AdventOfRust` is a Rust workspace destined to hold my Advent of Code solutions for the puzzles. I intend to solve each puzzle as soon as they are published, but this rule is not strict at all and I will try them whenever I have time. Check out Advent of Code here -> [adventofcode.com](https://adventofcode.com/)
